GuitarChords

A midi guitar chord generator. It takes two input midi notes, and generates the corresponding ones of the desired chord as a 'real' guitar would do.
The chord notes are hard written in the chords.cpp file.

I would like to continue adding a strum speed variable and more ways of playing the same chord placing them on different octaves of the keyboard.

The lowest note tells the chord's root note and the interval with the consequent the chord type.
